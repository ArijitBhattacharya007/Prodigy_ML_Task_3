🚀 Project Update! 🐱🐶

I'm excited to share our progress on Task-03: classifying images of cats and dogs using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. 📷✨

Objective: Implement an SVM to accurately classify images of cats and dogs from the Kaggle dataset.

Steps:

Data Collection: Download and organize the cat and dog images from the Kaggle dataset.
Data Preprocessing: Prepare the images for analysis by resizing, normalizing, and augmenting them.
Model Implementation: Develop and train an SVM model to distinguish between cat and dog images.
Model Evaluation: Test the model's accuracy and fine-tune parameters to improve performance.
Insights and Reporting: Analyze the results and provide insights on the model's effectiveness in image classification.
Looking forward to sharing more updates as we advance through this exciting task! 🌟
